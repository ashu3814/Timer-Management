# ⏱️ Timer Management App

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **React-based Timer Management App** built as part of an **assignment**. It demonstrates my ability to develop a feature-rich web application from scratch, showcasing **state management, UI responsiveness, animations, and interactivity**. The app enables users to **create, edit, start, pause, reset, and delete timers**, with a visually appealing **circular countdown animation**. It also features **dynamic background gradients based on categories, keyboard shortcuts, sound alerts, dark mode, and category filtering**.


## 🎯 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- Users can **add timers** by specifying:
  - Timer **name**
  - **Duration** (selectable in **seconds or minutes**)
  - **Category** (affects background gradient)
- **Start, Pause, and Reset** functionality for each timer
- **Edit timers** (change name, duration, or category)
- **Delete timers** when no longer needed
- **Circular countdown animation** that dynamically changes color based on remaining time
- **Dynamic background gradients** generated based on timer category
- **Sound alert** when a timer reaches zero
- **Visual notification system** for completed timers

### ✅ Enhanced User Experience
- **Dark Mode** support with persistent preference
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for controlling active timers:
  - Space/P: Pause running timer
  - R: Reset timer
- **Category filtering** to display only timers from a specific category
- **Predefined categories** for quick selection (Work, Exercise, Study, Cooking, Meditation, Break)
- **Visual indicators** for running timers (pulsing animation)
- **Responsive controls** with visual feedback
- **Local storage** for persistent timer data between sessions

### 📱 Mobile Responsiveness
- **Adaptive Grid Layout:**
  - **Desktop** → 3 timers per row
  - **Tablet** → 2 timers per row
  - **Mobile** → 1 timer per row
- **Responsive sidebar** that adjusts to screen size
- Buttons, fonts, and layouts scale properly for different devices
- **Touch-friendly** design with appropriately sized interactive elements

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### **React Hooks & State Management**
- Used `useState` for component state management
- Implemented `useEffect` for:
  - Timer countdown logic
  - Local storage persistence
  - Keyboard shortcut handling
  - Dark mode preference

### **Timer Functionality**
- **Efficient interval management** to avoid memory leaks
- **Unit conversion** between minutes and seconds
- **Dynamic progress calculation** for visual indicators
- **Sound integration** using Howler.js

### **UI/UX Design**
- **SVG-based circular progress** with dynamic color transitions
- **CSS animations** for visual feedback (pulsing, slide-in notifications)
- **Consistent color scheme** with meaningful color coding
- **Intuitive layout** with clear visual hierarchy

### **Responsive Design Approach**
- **CSS Grid** for adaptive layouts
- **Flexbox** for component alignment
- **Media queries** for breakpoint-specific styling
- **Relative units** (em, rem) for scalable typography

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

### **Functionality Testing**
- Verified timer accuracy across different durations
- Ensured edit/delete operations maintain data integrity
- Tested keyboard shortcuts in various scenarios
- Validated category filtering functionality

### **Responsive Testing**
- **Chrome DevTools** Device Mode
- **Physical device testing** on:
  - Desktop (1920x1080)
  - Tablet (iPad 10.2")
  - Mobile (iPhone 13)
- **Cross-browser testing** on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

## 🎨 Figma Design Process

The UI/UX design for this project was created in Figma, following a systematic design process:

1. **Research & Inspiration**
   - Analyzed existing timer applications
   - Created a mood board for visual inspiration
   - Identified key user needs and pain points

2. **Wireframing**
   - Sketched low-fidelity wireframes for key screens
   - Mapped user flows and interactions
   - Established layout grid and spacing system

3. **Visual Design**
   - Developed color palette with light and dark variants
   - Created component library (buttons, cards, inputs)
   - Designed responsive layouts for different screen sizes

4. **Prototyping**
   - Built interactive prototype to test user flows
   - Animated key interactions and transitions
   - Validated design with peer feedback

5. **Design Handoff**
   - Prepared design specs and assets for development
   - Documented component behavior and states
   - Created responsive design guidelines


## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Timer Templates** for quickly creating common timers
- **Timer Groups** for running multiple timers in sequence
- **Statistics Dashboard** to track timer usage patterns
- **Export/Import** functionality for backing up timer data
- **Timer Sharing** via generated links
- **Push Notifications** for timer completion when tab is not active

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **React** - UI library
- **CSS3** - Styling with custom properties for theming
- **Howler.js** - Audio playback
- **LocalStorage API** - Persistent data storage
- **Figma** - UI/UX design and prototyping
